Homework week 8
1.	Given n cities and m roads connecting cities.
The dirty level between two cities u, v is D[u,v] (D[u,v] might be negative).  
Your task is to write a program to find a path from a starting point s to the end point e
such that the total dirty level on the path is the smallest.

Input:  Data come from file dirty.txt in the following format:
-	The first line contains four integer numbers n, m, s, e
-	m following lines each contains 3 integer numbers u,v, d 
indicating that the dirty level of road from u to v is d.

Output: Results are written to file “dirty.out” in the following format:
-	The first line contains the total dirty level of the path
-	The second line contains cities on the path from s to e.

2.	Given a computer network of n computers. 
The cost to connect two computers u and v is D[u,v]>0. 
If computer u is connected with computer b, and computer b is connected with computer c, 
we say that computer a is connected with computer c. 
Your task is to find the minimum cost to connect computers such that all computers are connected.

Input:  Data come from file “connection.txt” as described below:
-	The first line contains two integer numbers n, m
-	m following lines each contains 3 integer numbers u, v, d indicating that the cost to connect computer  u and computer v is d.

Output: Results are written to file “connection.out” as described below:
-	The first line contains the total cost.
-	Following lines each contains three numbers u, v, d indicating that u and v are connected with the cost d.
