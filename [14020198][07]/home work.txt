Homework week 7
1.	Given a computer networks with n nodes and m edges. 
Your task is to assign each node a label such that if there is an edge from u to v, 
the label of u is smaller than the label of v. 

Input: Data from network.txt as described below:
-	The first line contains two integer numbers n, m.
-	m following line each lines contains 2 integer number u, v 
	indicating that there is an edge from u to v.

Output: Data is out to network.out containing a line of n labels for nodes from 1 to n.


2.	Given n cities and m roads connecting cities. 
The road length between two cities u, v is d[u,v] > 0.  
Your task is to write a program to find the shortest path 
from a starting point s to the end point e.

Input:  Data is from roads.txt as described below:
-	The first line contains four integer numbers n, m,s,e
-	m following lines each contains 3 integer number u,v, d 
	indicating that the length of road from u to v is d.

Output: Data is out to file “roads.out” as described below:
-	The first line contains the length of the shortest path from s to e
-	The second line contains cities on the shortest path from s to e.
